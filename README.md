PM-Demo is not only the demo version of PMFriday, [repo here](https://github.com/AuguestGao/PMFriday), but also part of a tutorial of a React intermediate-level project for those who learned ReactJs but have a hard time to put everything together for the first time. (*Still working on it, stay tuned.*)
